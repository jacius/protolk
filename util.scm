;;; Returns #t if x is #<unspecified>
(define (void? x) (equal? x (void)))


;;; Returns a lambda that takes a pair and returns true if the car of
;;; that pair matches x. The keyword argument pred is the predicate to
;;; use for comparing x to the car of the pair. This is mainly useful
;;; for searching or filtering alists.
;;;
;;; Example:
;;;
;;; ((car=? b) '(b . 2))
;;; ; #t
;;;
;;; (remove (car=? 'b) '((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3)))
;;; ; ((a . 1) (c . 3))
;;;
