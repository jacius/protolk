* About Protolk

Protolk provides flexible object oriented programming in Scheme,
combining [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(object-oriented_programming)][encapsulation]] and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing][message passing]] a la Smalltalk and Ruby,
with [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming][prototypal inheritance]] a la Self and JavaScript.

Protolk is not a new language or dialect. It offers a Scheme record
type, and collection of procedures that can be seamlessly integrated
with other Scheme code. Some optional reader extensions are also
available, to add some syntax sugar for convenience.

Protolk is designed with four core principles in mind:

- *Simplicity:* Protolk's object model is very simple: an object holds
  its own properties and methods, it inherits properties and methods
  from an (optional) base object, and it performs actions in response
  to messages. That's all there is to it. However...

- *Extensibility:* ... it's easy to build complex and interesting
  behavior on top of that simple object model. You can extend,
  customize, or replace pretty much anything about Protolk, including
  much of the inheritance system!

- *Flexibility:* Objects can be modified in any way at any time. You
  don't have to declare ahead of time what properties or methods an
  object will have, or redefine an entire class just to add a property
  or method to a single object.

- *Encapsulation:* Objects maintain a separation between their private
  state and their public interfaces. Properties are only (directly)
  read or written by the object itself. Methods are public by nature,
  but there are ways to implement private methods.


* Installation and Usage

You currently need [[http://call-cc.org/][Chicken Scheme]] to use Protolk. After you have
installed Chicken, you can install the latest release of Protolk by
running =chicken-install protolk=. Or, if you want the absolute latest
revision of Protolk, you can clone the git repository then run the
=chicken-install= command from within the repository clone directory.

To use Protolk in your code:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(require-extension protolk
                   protolk-stdpob
                   protolk-syntax-send-brackets
                   protolk-syntax-own-prop-at)
#+END_SRC

When you compile the file, if you are using Protolk's syntax sugar,
you will need to tell the compiler to load the syntax modules as
compiler extensions:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
csc -X protolk-syntax-send-brackets -X protolk-syntax-own-prop-at  your-code.scm
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you don't want to use syntax sugar, you don't need those flags, and
you can omit the syntax modules from the =require-extension=
expression shown above.

For working code samples, see the files in the =demo= directory.


* Caveats

As of November 2012, Protolk is still just an experiment. I make no
guarantees about its performance, efficiency, stability, security,
correctness, usefulness, or cleverness. Think twice (or thrice) before
using Protolk in production code.

Be aware that Protolk is based on *synchronous* (blocking) message
passing, implemented as procedure calls. No special consideration has
been given to issues of concurrency, threading, or asynchronicity.
So, Protolk probably does not offer any special benefit for
distributed or parallel computing. (But, Protolk is flexible enough
that you can easily create Protolk objects that implement message
queues or other form of asynchronous message passing.)

Protolk is currently targeted at [[http://call-cc.org/][Chicken Scheme]]. If you are interested
in helping to port Protolk to your favorite Scheme or Lisp, create a
new issue on the [[https://gitlab.com/jcroisant/protolk/issues][Protolk issue tracker]] or email me.
